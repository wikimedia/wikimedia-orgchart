This project can use any kind of database, so long as you set up the following as exports:

function listHierarchy() // return a dictionary with at least a 'none' index, listing IDs
                         // of all units in the database in the values, corresponding to
                         // the indexes, which indicate the parent unit of the values.

function getUnit(id) // return a dictionary representing one unit, fields present should be
                     // title, supervisor, name, reqn, start, end, hours, status, location

function changeUnit(id, mods) // modify a unit, accepts an id like getUnit, but then should
                              // take new values in mods and make them current.

var locs // a dictionary with locations used in the database as indexes, and HTML color
         // codes as values--these will be used to style the data.

OPTIONAL:

function loadToDb(path) // load the file at `path` into the database--this will be used
                        // to allow uploads from the web client, so if you don't want to
                        // allow that, just don't define this function.

function uploadToDb(response, request) // this should implement the POST handler for the
                                       // database upload functionality, so don't do this
                                       // if you aren't accepting uploads.
